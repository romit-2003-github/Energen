        "title": "Gluten-free Samosas",
        "ingredients":"1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup cold water, 1 large potato, peeled and diced, 1/2 cup frozen green peas, 1/2 onion, diced, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 tbsp grated ginger, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp vegetable oil",
        "substitues":"1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (such as Bob's Red Mill",
        "method":"To make the pastry, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the vegetable oil and use a fork to mix until crumbly. Gradually add the cold water, stirring until the mixture forms a ball. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes. To make the filling, boil the diced potato until tender. Drain and set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and saut√© until soft and translucent. Add the cooked potato, green peas, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the filling is well combined and heated through. Preheat the oil for frying in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Roll out the pastry dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/8 inch thick. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough, about 3 inches in diameter. Place a spoonful of the filling in the centre of each circle. Fold the circle in half to form a triangle shape, and pinch the edges together to seal. Fry the samosas in the preheated oil in batches, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the samosas from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve the samosas hot with chutney or raita."
